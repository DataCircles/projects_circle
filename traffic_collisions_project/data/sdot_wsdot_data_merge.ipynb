    "# Documentation: Merging WSDOT and SDOT Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the process of merging the traffic collision data from the Seattle Dept. of Transportation (SDOT) with the Wash. State Dept. of Transportation (WSDOT).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I used an inner join, but given the work everyone has already done on the SDOT data, I decided to keep all the SDOT data in the merged data set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WSDOT data\n",
    "On 8/6/20, I received a CSV file in response to my earlier public records request for King County data: 579,792 total rows; 212,396 with City listed as Seattle; 255 columns   \n",
    "\n",
    "Data spans 2005-2020: I requested data from 2004 to the present, but was told the data is only available beginning in 2005.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When I initially read the CSV file from WSDOT, I got this Unicode error:  \n",
    "`UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa7 in position 19: invalid start byte`  \n",
    "so I used `encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\"` to read file  \n",
    "\n",
    "Columns that begin with TZ refer to Target Zero, and [Appendix E](http://targetzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TargetZero2019_Appendices_Lo-Res.pdf) describes all the TZ variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2000, Wash. State set the Target Zero goal: zero deaths and serious injuries by 2030. In measuring progress, the WSDOT uses (1) Rates based on vehicle miles traveled (VMT), (2) Rates based on population (aka 100,000 people), and (3) Rates based on licensed or endorsed drivers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Collision Location and Analysis System (CLAS), a crash data repository, is the source of Target Zero’s serious injury data. CLAS is housed at the WSDOT and most of the data comes from law enforcement officers via the Police Traffic Collision Report (PTCR). Citizens may also submit non-police assisted reports of crash events via the Citizen Vehicle Collision Report.  \n",
    "\n",
    "CLAS stores all reportable traffic crash data for Washington State public roadways. A crash needs to meet at least one of the two following criteria to be considered reportable: 1) a minimum property damage\n",
    "threshold of \\$1,000, and/or 2) bodily injury occurred as a result of the crash. See [targetzero.com](https://targetzero.com) for information.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SDOT data\n",
    "I downloaded the publicly available CSV file on 8/7/20 (220,650 rows & 40 columns) and the data spans the years 2004-2020   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Data \n",
    "May want to request Department of Licensing Driver Record Data. The Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) provides the driver record data used in Target Zero from their Drivers Data Mart database. This data is updated daily from several sources, and contains the complete driver records for all Washington drivers.  "
